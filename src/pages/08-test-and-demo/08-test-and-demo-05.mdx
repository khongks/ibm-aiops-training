**ðŸ“£ <u>Narration</u>**

In this demo I am the application SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) responsible for an e-commerce website called RobotShop, an online store operated by my company. In the middle of the day (when clients make most of the purchases) I received a slack message on my mobile, alerting me that there is some problem with the site.

Letâ€™s verify whatâ€™s going on with the RobotShop site. The application is up but displays an error that it cannot get any ratings.




## ðŸ“¥ STEP: Verify ratings are not showing

>**ðŸš€ <u>Action</u>**
Open any robot details to show that there are no ratings displayed.

**ðŸ“£ <u>Narration</u>**

I know that there are many ratings for each of the products that we sell, so when none are displayed, it means that there is a likely problem with `Ratings` service withing application that may heavily impact clientâ€™s purchasing decisions, as well as may be a sign of a wider outage.

**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

Most large organizations use IT Service Management tools to govern processes around IT. Our organization is using ServiceNow for that purpose. Past incidents with resolution information are ingested and analysed by CloudPak for AIOps.

The IBM CloudPak for AIOps trains on exisitng tickets and it extracts the steps used to fix previous incidents (if documented) and recommend resolutions using natural language processing. This AI model helps you discover historical incidents to aid in the remediation of current problems. 

So for the **Story**, your team is presented with the top-ranked similar incidents from the past. These relevant similar incidents help speed up incident resolution even if the I don't have access to ServiceNow. Without these features, your team must manually search for past incidents and resolutions, which is time-consuming.

In this particular example I can see that the problem was related to a GIT Commit that massivly reduced the resource limits has been commited by DEV on the mysql Deployment.

Let me check how the problem was resolved for this incident.

**❗ <u>Note</u>**:  In the Robot Shop demo scenario, the integration with ServiceNow is simulated with the static content.

It seems that it was resolved by changing the mysql deployment and a Runbook had been created to mitigate the problem.

To finish up, I will check if the incident was related to an official change.

## 📥 STEP: Examine the Change

**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

Ok, so now I can see that the problem is related to a Change that aims to reduce the footprint of the mysql database.

As it's still ongoing, chances are high, that the development team recreated a similar problem.

Obviously, in real life I would now start the Runbook to see if it resolves the problem.
But for the sake of the demo, let's dig a little deeper first.

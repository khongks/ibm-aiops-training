## 🚀 TASK: Install the Operator
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-aiops/4.2.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation" target="_blank" >🌏 Documentation for the Task: Online starter installation of CP4AIOPS</a>

Next you have to install the CP4AIOPS Operator by creating the `Subscription` as described in the Documentation.

1. Run the following command:
 
	```yaml
	cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
	apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
	kind: Subscription
	metadata:
	  name: ibm-aiops-orchestrator
	  namespace: ibm-aiops
	spec:
	  channel: v4.2
	  installPlanApproval: Automatic
	  name: ibm-aiops-orchestrator
	  source: ibm-operator-catalog
	  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
	EOF

</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

<InlineNotification kind="info">

This creates the Operator Instance via the `Subscription` that will be looking for an `Installation` definition and start the installation if it exists (you will create this in one of the next steps).
